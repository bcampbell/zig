Getting Started
===============


$ cd src
$ make


Required libraries
------------------

SDL2 (http://www.libsdl.org)
SDL2_mixer (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
libpng
zlib



Stubbing out the sound
----------------------

The sound playing code is in soundmgr.[h|cpp]. It uses SDL_mixer to actually
send sounddata to the hardware.
It uses the retromat code to generate the sound effects upon startup.

There is already a NullSoundMgr class you can use, which doesn't require
the retromat code, STK or SDL_Mixer.

So, to stub out the sound:

1) in soundmgr.[h|cpp], #ifdef out the RealSoundManager class
2) remove the retromat files from the project
3) #ifdef out the RealSoundManager creation in zig.cpp

That's it!




Coding Stuff
============


Files of interest
-----------------

zig.cpp holds the main() function. The main 'flow' of the game is
pretty obvious here.
zig.h has all the global vars defined.

There isn't really a main loop in main(). Instead, I'll create a
Scene-derived object (eg titlescreen, level, gameover screen etc...),
and call Run() on it. When Run() finishes, I'll examine the result and
go on to the next scene.

So the main loop actually lives in Scene::Run() (in scene.cpp).

Most of the bad dudes live in dudes.[h|cpp], but some have their own files
(eg boss.[h|cpp]).

Base entity class is Agent, in agent.[h|cpp]. Lots of comments in there.

level.[h|cpp] defines the Level class (derived from Scene), which drives most
of the main game action.

background.[h|cpp] defines the in-game backgrounds (purplish perlin noise or
retro grid).

See data/levels for descriptions of all the bad dudes - in the source it can
sometimes be a little hard to tell which dude is which unless you know the
names. Also, there are a few experimental/obsolete dudes still in the
source which aren't used (eg boids).


Texture Management
------------------

There isn't really any :-)
All textures are passed to Display::AddTexture() to register them with
the display system.

Most of the textures are global - created at startup, destroyed at shutdown.
Snowflake (in dudes.[h|cpp] is an example of a more transient texture - each
snowflake dude has its own procedural texture which lasts as long as the
snowflake does.

If the display mode is changed the textures are flushed from GL and
reloaded by running through each one in turn and calling its virtual
UploadToGL() function.
